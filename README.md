## Project Overview

The project started with the need statement from our course instructor for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. The challenge is to design a smart city proposal for an area of 1500 square kilometres, which the government of India wants to convert into a sustainable and technologically advanced city.

The proposal must cover various aspects such as:

- City layout plan
- Budget and revenue models
- Sustainability measures
- Human population distribution
- Other supporting and relevant information

### Key Assumptions for the Proposal:

- **Area:** 1500 sq.km
- **Location:** State government oversight
- **Natural features:** Mountains, lakes, and water bodies

## Overview of Goutham

Inspired by the transformation of Gotham City from the DC Comics universe, the Goutham Smart City proposal envisions a technologically advanced metropolis that prioritizes sustainability and growth. However, unlike the fictional downfall of Gotham, Goutham aims to be a city with real-world feasibility, avoiding the mistakes of failed cities like Lavasa and Masdar.

The city will be built by connecting existing towns and cities, including Dahod, Limdi, Singwad, Fatepura, Santroad, Piplod, Golav, and Ruvabari. These towns will retain their names but will be governed as part of Goutham. Efforts will also be made to celebrate and preserve the local culture and heritage while modernizing the infrastructure.

### Location and Climate

Goutham is planned to be situated on the Chota Udaipur Hills and Gujarat plains. This location experiences a moderate climate with gentle temperature fluctuations throughout the year. It receives about 1200mm of rainfall annually, and its main water supply will be sourced from local lakes and reservoirs.
